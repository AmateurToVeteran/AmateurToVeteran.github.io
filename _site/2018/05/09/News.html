	<h2 id="donald-trump-pulled-the-us-out-of-the-nuclear-deal-with-iran-last-night">Donald Trump pulled the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran last night.</h2>

<p>This move marked a bitter defaut for the US’s European allies. France, UK and Germany spent months persuading the US president to stay in the accord. The Trump adiministration don’t believe the aggrement can prevent Iran from developing the nuclear programming. They believe that only the economic sanctions can achieve the goal. Morever, the U.S. want to demonstrate where is its bottomline to the North Korea before  the forthcoming summit.</p>

<p>France, UK and Germany still want to negotiate a new deal which will cover more aspects such as stop supporting the terrorism and development of balistic missile, etc. The Trump administration is unlikly to satisify with the proposal.</p>

<p>The sanctions helped the oil recovered from the previous loss. WTI close at aroung $69. The sactions will be effective in 6 months or so.</p>

<h2 id="money-supply-squeez-adds-to-case-against-uk-rates-increase">Money supply squeez adds to case against UK rates increase.</h2>

<p>From historical data, the money supply is a good indicator of the economic growth. Money supply figures have seen growth rates fall to their lowest level for six years. It it verey natural to assume that  the amount of money people have in their bank account is a indicator of the future spending. The growth rate of M1 has fallen to zero after adjusting for inflation. BOE will have montary policy meeting tomorrow, the week growth in money supply may become of a warning of the week economic growth which will prevent BOE from tightening the monetary policy, i.e. increase the benchmark interest rate. If this is the case. The pounds may depreciate furthur aginst Euro and Dollar. Espcially dollat, the interest rate differential and the higher growth rate in US will strenthen the Dollar.</p>

<h2 id="job-openings-hit-a-high-as-wage-growth-remains-sluggish">Job openings hit a high as wage growth remains sluggish.</h2>

<p>The number of jobs opening in the US has sored to a record high as employers struggle to fill the vacancies and the unemployment rate slides. In March, there was exactly one job opening for every umemployed individuals. The drivers of the recent wage growth are low end earner industries like restaurant, grocery stores, the service for the elderly, etc. They experieced the fatest growth rate compared to 10 years ago. However, the growth rate of the rest 80% industries remains steady and little bit lower than that of 10 years ago. They haven’t shown any up trends. The headline inflation is close to 2 per cent which is Fed’s target, and the unemployement is 3.9 percent. The Fed may need to increase the interest rate to preventing the overheating of the economy. Feb seems to be happy to allow a slight overshoot of the inflation.</p>

<p>The trade war between China and US makes the things more complicated. One question is whether the trade tension will damage corporate sentiment enough to deter policymak- ers from opting for four rate rises this year, instead of the three signalled in their March forecasting round.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the trade war will have negative impact on US economy, the Fed will stick to the original plan : three rate rise this year.</p>

<h2 id="trump-declares-trade-war-with-china">Trump declares trade war with China.</h2>

<p>“The president’s demand on tarrifs and imports are ridiculous. No sovereign state could accept them” from Martin Wolf.</p>

<p>What is to be made of these demands? The call for a reduction of the bilateral deficits by $200bn (up from $100bn) is ridiculous. It would require the Chinese state to take control over the economy — precisely what, in other respects, the US demands it not do. It is a violation of the principles of non-discrimination, multi- lateralism and market-conformity that underpin the trading system the US cre- ated. It should be ashamed of itself. It ignores the overwhelming probability that this will not reduce overall US defi- cits, particularly given US fiscal irre- sponsibility. It ignores the inevitable adverse effects on third countries.</p>

<p>The demand that China have the same tariffs as the US is almost as ridicu- lous. There is no economic case for such a policy. It would be far more reasonable to demand that it move towards the same average tariff as the US or EU.</p>

<p>A serious discussion should indeed be had on the terms of foreign investment in China and Chinese investment in the US. So, too, must there be a discussion of intellectual property protection and cyber-espionage. But China could never accept the idea that the US may prevent it from upgrading its technology.</p>

<p>The notion that the US may insist on unrestricted access for investment in China while reserving the right to restrict Chinese investment, as it wishes, must also be unacceptable.</p>

<p>Finally, the idea that the US will be judge, jury and executioner, while China will be deprived of the rights to retaliate or seek recourse to the WTO is crazy. No great sovereign power could accept such a humiliation. For China, it would be a modern version of the “unequal trea- ties” of the 19th century.</p>

<p>The Americans seem sure they can force the Chinese to sue for terms, how-ever foolish and humiliating these are. China would indeed be hurt more by a tit-for-tat tariff war than the US. This is because its exports to the US dwarf those from the US to China. A recent analysis from the Hoover Institution suggests that China’s economic growth might be reduced by 0.3 percentage points in a tariff war. That is far more costly than to the US, but it would be survivable for an economy as dynamic as China’s. To China’s leaders, such costs would be dwarfed by those of abject sur- render.</p>

<p>Both economically and politically, the US is going about this in the wrong way, not only because it is seeking to humili- ate China, but because it is simultane- ously waging commercial war on its potential allies. The right path for every- body would be to make the discussion multilateral, not narrowly bilateral. China should recognise that, though still a developing country in some respects, it is also a superpower. It should embrace the principles of rules-gov- erned openness and liberal trade.</p>

<p>A renewal of the lapsed multilateral trade negotiation, built around opening up the Chinese economy, could, as the Chinese say, be a “win-win” for every- body. China should take the lead. The Europeans and Japanese should support the idea.</p>

<p>Americans who are better aware of the national interest than the adminis- tration need to understand that the US will find itself on its own if it seeks con- flict. That is what must happen when a leader turns into a self-regarding bully.</p>

<p>All I want to say after reading this article is that China is not Iran. You Americans cannot beat us. Trump will step down when all his supporters suffer from the trade war. In such circumstance, the political system of China can ensure China can fight until the last minutes, whereas, the voters in the US cannot accept such a loss they will select another president to replace the one and the only Stupid Trump. And eventually, China will become the most powerful country in the world, the “world police” need to go back to home and take care of his own business, never intervening other countries.</p>
