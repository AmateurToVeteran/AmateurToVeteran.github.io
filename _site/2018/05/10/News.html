<p>The oil price is still mainly driven by the decision made by Trump to pull the US out of the Iran nuclear deal and impose sanctions, which will cut the tight oil supply further. The energy stocks benefit from the buoyant oil price. Brent crude rose as high as $77.43 a barrel, the WTI hit $71.29 – with further support coming from news of a bigger than forecast drop in US crude oil and gasoline inventories last week. The data can be found <a href="https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/">here</a></p>

<p>Dollar paused after reaching its highest level this year against a basket of currencies.</p>

<p>Sterling edged higher as the markets are waiting for the signals from today’s BOE monetary policy committee meeting. The pound has retreated sharply since the middle of last month because the market expects a rate rise this month. However, the economic data shows that it is not a good time to increase the interest rate. From the BoE meeting, the BoE think that the economic growth slowdown is just a temporary phenomenon, which is partly due to the bad weather. The BoE expects that the growth will accelerate in the second quarter and they will not rule out the possibility of the rate rise this year. I think tomorrow the sterling will rise correspondingly.</p>

<h2 id="markets-focus-on-the-geopolitical-risks">Markets focus on the geopolitical risks</h2>

<p>Whether France, UK, and Germany can keep the nuclear deal without the US, how they handle the possible sanctions on European companies and financial institutions. How they find a way to give Iran credit line. If the nuclear deal stops, then there is a big probability of war in the Middle East, as Iran will continue its research, the US will impose sanctions, even have a military operation against Iran, like Iraq war. Oil price, the gold price will be sensitive to the possible events.</p>

<p>The summit between the US and North Korea will be held on 12th June in Singapore. This will be another uncertainty. Whether North Korea will dismantle all its nuclear program as well as missile program will draw everyone’s attention.</p>

<h2 id="china-credit-spreads-near-2-year-high-as-debt-crackdown-sparks-default-worries">China credit spreads near 2-year high as debt crackdown sparks default worries.</h2>

<p>China credit spreads hit their widest level in nearly two years this week following new regulations that undermined long-held assumptions about implicit guarantees on debt linked to local governments. Needs to do more research on this.</p>
