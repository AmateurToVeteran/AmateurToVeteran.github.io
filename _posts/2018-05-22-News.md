## U.S. government bond yields keep unchanged following the two-year auction.

U.S. government bond stalled Tuesday as a dearth of economic data and a relatively uneventful debt auction left many investors sitting on the sidelines.

The bond prices rose overnight as the investors braced for the political uncertainty under the country's new government, as a result, the yield slipped. After that, the yield travelled sideways, with some analysts attributing the lull in trading to a dearth of economic data on the calendar. Bond yield largely held steady after the Treasury sold $33 billion of 2-year notes at a high yield of 2.59% which is slightly lower than where they traded before the auction. The absence of a so-called tail - when the highest yield sold in the auction exceeds the highest yield expected when the auction began - suggested there was a fair demand among investors for the bonds, something analysts said helped keep the market steady. On the contrary, if the tail occurred, it indicates the lack of interest in the bond, which will drag down the bond price and push the yield higher.

The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday afternoon will publish minutes from its May 1-2 meeting, in which it held short-term interest rates steady. Analysts say they will be parsing the minutes for clues into the central bankâ€™s thinking on the path of interest rates.

## Oil price fluctuates.

The oil price broke through $80 a barrel threshold after the U.S. threatened to tighten economic sanctions against Iran. After that, it fell amid concerns about the possible trade war. The oil market likes free trade. Any time there's concerns about a trade war, it weighs on prices.

But Brent crude, still ended at $79.57 (0.44% up) which is a 3.5 year high, whereas the WTI fell 11 cents ending at $72.13 a barrel. 

Also weighing on prices in late trading was a report from Reuters that the OPEC will consider raising output as its June meeting amid mounting concerns that drop-offs in supply from Iran and Venezuela will lift prices so high that it will dent demand.
