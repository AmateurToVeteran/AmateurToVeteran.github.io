## The drivers of the oil price

Like other products, the price of Crude oil is driven by supply and demand. 

**_From the supply side_**, the largest oil producer worldwide as of 2017 are as follows:  
1. United States: 14.9 million barrels per day
2. Saudi Arabia: 12.4
3. Russia: 11.2
4. China: 4.8
5. Canada: 4.6
6. Iraq: 4.4
7. Iran: 4.2
8. UAE: 3.8
9. Brazil: 3.2
10. Kuwait: 3.1

Some of the biggest oil producer formed the [OPEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC), the purpose of the OPEC is to coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets, in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry.  OPEC is, in fact, a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition and influence the oil price.

From the history, OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations:  
1. In the 1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices, with long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy
2. In the 1980s, OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations. Normally when the production targets are reduced, oil prices increase. Most recently from the organization's 2016 decision to trim oversupply. (A deal with Russia)

Another big uncertainty of oil market is the US shale oil. The boom in American shale oil has played a significant role in the nations' economic recovery and in lowering the oil price globally. With the development of fracking technology, the shale oil companies have contributed to the dramatic increase in U.S. oil production, which has risen from 5 million barrels a day in 2010, to over 9 million barrels a day currently. 

There is a balance between OPEC and US shale companies. Opec cut production --> oil price increase --> the U.S shale company will expand their production (the number of rigs and wells can be a good indicator) -- > oil price plummet to a certain level --> the shale company will stop production because the profit margin is squeezed.

Moreover, the geopolitical factors is very important. The wars or civil disorders in the middle-east can lead to extended interruptions in supply which will lead to the price rally. For instance, the Iraq war and the the pull out of US from the Iran nuclear deal.

**_From the demand side_** 

The economic growth is the driver from the demand side. When the global economy slide to recession, the demand will decrease, as a result the oil price will fall. Also the renewable energy may be a possible factor. With the shift from crude oil to renewable energy, the demand may decrease.
