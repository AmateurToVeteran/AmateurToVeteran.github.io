## Two types of oil markets.

Crude oil trades through two primary markets:

**_Western Intermediate_** : the underlying commodity of the New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. Light, sweet crude oil is commonly referred to as "oil" in the western world. WTI is considered a "sweet" crude because it contains less than 0.42 percent sulfur. Surful is undesirable in petroleum because it lowers the yield of high-value products including gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel as well as plastics and other petroleum-derived products. WTI crude oil is produced in America. It is actually a blend of several U.S. domestic streams of light sweet crude oils. Even though WTI is the highest-quality light sweet crude available, it is not the most used oil. That title goes to Brent crude. WTI's market is primarily the United States. This is partially due to an export ban on U.S. crude oil, which was reversed in late 2015. 

Although WTI is a sweeter and lighter crude than Brent, **a major drawback is that it is landlocked meaning that transportation is more expensive and more involved than it is for a waterborne crude oil such as Brent.** WTI is extracted across the US and sent via pipeline to Cushing, Oklahoma where it is stored. Then it must rely on the capacity of pipelines or rail to get it to refiners in the gulf coast region.


**_Brent Oil_**: Originally Brent referred to oil extracted from the Brent oilfield located in the North Sea off the coast of UK, however, for various reasons Brent now refers to four different crude oil grades extracted from various wells in the North Sea - Brent blend, Forties blend, Osberg, and Ekofisk. The mixing of the four oil grades actually made Brent a heavier oil, although it is still considered to be relatively light and low in sulfur. The fact that it is waterborne from oil fields near to the coast of the UK and Norway makes it all the more attractive. Transportation of Brent is easier and less costly thanks to the location of its extraction sites. **The relative ease of transportation and its high quality makes Brent an attractive investment and plays a major part in the pricing of crude oil as well as in the adoption of Brent as the major oil benchmark price globally.**


Here is a good picture which illustrates the difference between these two type of crude oil:
